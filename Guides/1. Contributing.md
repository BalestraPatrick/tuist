# Contributing

If you landed here for the first time, welcome! ðŸŽ‰ We love getting help from external contributors that improve and move xpm forward. In these pages you should find all the information that you need to make great contributions to the project. The Xcode Project Manager is a project that companies depend on in a daily basis so there are certain code standards and conventions that you'll find along your contribution journey. If you are an app developer you might find some subtle differences in the way the code is structure, that's normal! The positive thing is that the programming language is the same and the patterns similar. You'll learn about those subtle differences in this reference and from other contributors that will review your PRS.
